				A Library Management System is a software built to handle the primary housekeeping functions of a library. Libraries rely on library management systems to manage asset collections as well as relationships with their members. Library management systems help libraries keep track of the books and their checkouts, as well as members’ subscriptions and profiles.

    		<p style="font-style:italic; color:red"> Generally, we hate sound effects libraries. There are several which are great, but most are rubbish. They usually have some kind of weird sound to them, are in weird and obviously up-sampled rates from low-rate recordings, or are sometimes even mono when they should be stereo/stereo when they should be mono. The one that gets me the most is the “nice fade in and out” they do on nearly all files. It basically means I have to spend the time to chop off their lousy fades so I can get what I need to crossfade.</p>

    		<p style="font-style:italic; color:red"> When it comes to ambience libraries, most of the attempts at it have been horrific. They have super loud levels so you have to bring the fader way down in the mix, those pesky fades, or just plain bad recordings. I even listened to one where you could hear the operator breathing. All of the libraries we’ve listened to until now have been in stereo. As you know from the Cinema Sound education, making a 5.1 or larger ambience from a stereo source is easy.</p>
